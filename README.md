# Wafflegeddon

A Godot Engine game, that you can play 
[here](https://delta-key.itch.io/wafflegeddon). Made for [Games Factory 
Jam](https://itch.io/jam/games-factory) and [Weekly Game Jam 
#46](https://itch.io/jam/weekly-game-jam-46).

We tried to go for a GameBoy style game here, since the restriction was 
to use only three colors. So, the graphics, resolution, controls, sound 
and et cetera were made with the GameBoy in mind. Music was made with 
Deflemask, using the Gameboy system, as well.

Turned out to be a bit buggy and rough on the edges, so we labeled it as 
a prototype.
